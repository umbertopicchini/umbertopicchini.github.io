<p>
Recent software is at <a href="https://github.com/umbertopicchini">my GitHUB</a>.\\
Here follows older code. First I consider two "bigger" pieces of software and then a list of smaller educational ones, e.g. used for teaching.
</p>

<h2><tt>abc-sde</tt></h2>

<b><a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/abc-sde/"><tt>abc-sde</tt> a MATLAB toolbox for approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) in stochastic differential equation models.</a></b><br>

<p>
It performs <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximate_Bayesian_computation">approximate Bayesian computation</a> for stochastic models having latent dynamics defined by stochastic differential equations (SDEs).
Both one- and multi-dimensional SDE systems are supported and partially observed systems are easily accommodated. Variance components for the "measurement error" affecting the data/observations
can be estimated. A 50-pages Reference Manual is provided with two case-studies implemented and discussed. The methodology is based on the research article <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.5459">available here</a>
which also provide an additional example. <br>
<tt>abc-sde</tt> has been partially supported by the Faculty of Science at Lund University during years 2012-2013.<br><br>

<h2>sde toolbox</h2>


<p>
<b>Warning: implemented inferential methods are rather outdated and the SDE Toolbox development is discontinued.</b>  <br>
<b><a href="http://sdetoolbox.sourceforge.net/">SDE Toolbox - Simulation and estimation of stochastic differential equations with MATLAB.</a></b><br>
This MATLAB package allows to simulate sample paths of a user defined It&#244; or Stratonovich
SDE, estimate parameters and obtain descriptive statistics of the underlying stochastic
process; users can also simulate an SDE chosen from a library of template models.<br>
