This is the personal page of Umberto Picchini, a Full Professor in Mathematical Statistics at the [Department of Mathematical Sciences](https://www.chalmers.se/en/departments/math/Pages/default.aspx) at Chalmers University of Technology and University of Gothenburg, Sweden. Here is <a href="https://www.gu.se/en/about/find-staff/umbertopicchini">my official university profile</a>. 

I am also:
* an Associate Editor for the [Scandinavian Journal of Statistics](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/14679469).
* a faculty member of the [Chalmers AI Research Centre](https://www.chalmers.se/en/centres/chair/). 

Let's [get in touch](contact) to talk about statistical inference (especially **Bayesian**), **likelihood-free/simulation-based** methods for models with intractable likelihoods, computational methods such as MCMC and sequential Monte Carlo, and the application of statistical inference in applied problems.

Interested in **Bayesian methods**? Check out [this page](bayes)!
