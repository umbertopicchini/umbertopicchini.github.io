This is the personal page of Umberto Picchini, an Associate Professor in Mathematical Statistics at the [Department of Mathematical Sciences](https://www.chalmers.se/en/departments/math/Pages/default.aspx) at Chalmers University of Technology and University of Gothenburg, Sweden. Here is <a href="https://www.chalmers.se/en/persons/picchini/">my official university profile</a>. I am also a faculty member of the [Chalmers AI Research Centre](https://www.chalmers.se/en/centres/chair/Pages/default.aspx). <a href="https://twitter.com/uPicchini?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" class="twitter-follow-button" data-show-count="false">Follow @uPicchini</a><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Let's [get in touch](contact) to talk about statistical inference (especially **Bayesian**), **likelihood-free** methods for models with intractable likelihoods, and **Monte Carlo** statistical methods such as MCMC and sequential Monte Carlo, and the application of statistical inference in applied problems.

Interested in **Bayesian methods**? Check out [this page](bayes)!
