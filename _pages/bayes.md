I am very interested in researching computational methods for [Bayesian inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_inference). 
For example approximate Bayesian computation (ABC), Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and sequential Monte Carlo (aka particle filters) 
for Bayesian inference. More in general I am interested in [likelihood-free inference](/research/#abc) for models having _intractable likelihoods_.

These interests are reflected in my [publications](/publications) and my [blog posts](https://umbertopicchini.wordpress.com/).

Bayes Nordics
======
I have created [Bayes Nordics](https://sites.google.com/site/bayesnordics/), a mail list that focusses on 
Bayesian-related events, activities and job-posts in the European Nordic countries.
**Please join in! It's free!**

One World ABC seminars
=====
I am co-organizer of the [One World online seminars on Approximate Bayesian Computation](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/news/upcoming-seminars/abcworldseminar). 

göBayes reading group
======
I have created a [reading group](https://www.chalmers.se/en/departments/math/research/seminar-series/Bayesian-Reading-Group/) in Göteborg, to discuss noteworthy Bayesian papers.

Study group in Bayesian methods at Lund University
======
In 2015-16 I have coordinated a group _"to advance the understanding and use of Bayesian methodology for the quantification and communication 
  of uncertainty at Lund University."_
We organized many activities and workshops, all available at [this page](http://www.maths.lth.se/matstat/staff/umberto/bayes-asg.html).
