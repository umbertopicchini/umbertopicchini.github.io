I am very interested in researching computational methods for [Bayesian inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_inference), especially 
simulation-based inference approaches (such as [ABC](/research/#abc)) for models having _intractable likelihoods_, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and sequential Monte Carlo (aka particle filters). 

These interests are reflected in my [publications](/publications) and my [blog posts](https://umbertopicchini.wordpress.com/).

Bayes Nordics
======
In 2016 I have created [Bayes Nordics](https://sites.google.com/site/bayesnordics/), a mail list that focusses on 
Bayesian-related events, activities and job-posts in the European Nordic countries. It is actively maintained and keeps spreading info. 
**Please join in! It's free!**

Bayesian computing without exact likelihoods 2023
=====
I co-organized the workshop [Bayesian computing without exact likelihoods](https://bayescomp-isba.github.io/SatelliteNoLikelihoods.html) 12-14 March 2023 in Levi (Finland), a satellite event of the BayesComp 2023 conference also held in Levi.

One World ABC seminars (2020--current)
=====
Since 2020 I am a co-organizer of the [One World online seminars on Approximate Bayesian Computation](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/news/upcoming-seminars/abcworldseminar).  All videos are available at the ISBA's [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcUPLIjKrJC_qwqWhDamlIw).

Bayes@Lund 2017 
======
In 2017 I organized the conference [Bayes@Lund](https://www.maths.lu.se/bayeslund2017/), with Ullrika Sahlin. It was well attended by a general public and scholars from many different departments. 

göBayes reading group
======
I have created a [reading group](https://www.chalmers.se/en/departments/math/research/seminar-series/Bayesian-Reading-Group/) in Göteborg, to discuss noteworthy Bayesian papers.

Study group in Bayesian methods at Lund University
======
In 2015-16 I have coordinated a group _"to advance the understanding and use of Bayesian methodology for the quantification and communication 
  of uncertainty at Lund University."_
We organized many activities and workshops, summarised in [this document](https://lucris.lub.lu.se/ws/portalfiles/portal/12160328/final_report.pdf).
