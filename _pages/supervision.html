<b>September 2020-ongoing</b>:  I am main supervisor for <a href="https://www.chalmers.se/en/staff/Pages/petarj.aspx">Petar Jovanovski</a> (Chalmers University). Petar is involved with 
  <a href="https://www.chalmers.se/en/departments/math/research/research-groups/AIMS/Pages/ai-project-5.aspx">simulation-based Bayesian inference and deep learning for stochastic modelling</a>.
<br>  
<b>2017-2021</b>: I have been main supervisor for <a href="https://samuelwiqvist.github.io/">Samuel Wiqvist</a> (Lund University).
He worked on Bayesian inference for intractable likelihoods, using particles-based methods (sequential Monte Carlo), approximate Bayesian computation and deep learning strategies using normalising flows. 
Samuel's research was partially funded by a grant from the Swedish National Research Council.<br>
  <a href="https://portal.research.lu.se/portal/en/publications/simulationbased-inference(f0a13485-bf5e-42df-a67f-60aeaa660054).html">Here</a> is his PhD thesis and here are <a href="https://samuelwiqvist.github.io/research/">his papers</a>. <br> <br>
