I am organizer for three series of seminars, see below.

Statistics seminars at Dept. Mathematical Sciences, Chalmers and University of Göteborg
======

This is the departmental [Stats series](https://www.chalmers.se/en/departments/math/calendar/Pages/default.aspx?fromDate=From%20date&toDate=To%20date&categories=Seminar), which is quite inclusive in terms of not exclusively hosting methodological seminars but also more applied ones, and of course also seminars that are more machine-learning and data-science oriented. I am the sole organizer and if you wish to be included in the mail-list please send me [an email](/contact). You can also stay informed on Twitter by following @StatsChalmersGU, the Statistics group account.
