I have been organizing seminars in all institutions I have been employed in.
Currently, I am organizer for three series of seminars, see below.

Statistics seminars at Dept. Mathematical Sciences, Chalmers and University of GÃ¶teborg
======

This is the departmental Stats series, which is quite inclusive in terms of not exclusively hosting methodological seminars but also more applied ones, and of course also seminars that are more machine-learning and data-science oriented.
